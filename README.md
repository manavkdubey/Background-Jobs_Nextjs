# Background Jobs in Next.js

This repository demonstrates how to handle background jobs in a **Next.js** application. Since Next.js is primarily a frontend and API-driven framework, executing long-running or scheduled tasks requires external services or workarounds. This project provides approaches for handling background jobs in a serverless or self-hosted environment.

## Features

- **Background job execution** using different methods
- **Serverless-compatible solutions** for Next.js
- **Integration with task queues** (e.g., Redis, BullMQ, or AWS SQS)
- **API routes to trigger jobs**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm
- Redis (if using BullMQ for job queues)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pavenue/Background-Jobs_Nextjs.git
cd Background-Jobs_Nextjs
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install  # or npm install
```

### Running the Project

Start the Next.js development server:

```sh
yarn dev  # or npm run dev
```

### Configuring Background Jobs

Depending on the background job method you choose, configuration will differ.

#### 1. **Using API Routes with Cron Jobs**

- Schedule periodic API calls using **cron jobs** (e.g., with GitHub Actions or an external service like [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/)).
- Example API route: `pages/api/background-job.js`

#### 2. **Using BullMQ with Redis** (Recommended for Server Environments)

- Install BullMQ:
  ```sh
  yarn add bullmq
  ```
- Set up a worker in `utils/worker.js`:
  ```js
  import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';
  import Redis from 'ioredis';

  const redisConnection = new Redis();
  const jobQueue = new Queue('jobQueue', { connection: redisConnection });

  new Worker('jobQueue', async job => {
    console.log('Processing job:', job.id);
  }, { connection: redisConnection });
  ```

#### 3. **Using AWS Lambda + SQS** (Recommended for Serverless Deployments)

- Push jobs to an **SQS queue** instead of handling them in Next.js.
- AWS Lambda functions can consume SQS messages asynchronously.

## Deployment

For deployment, consider:

- **Vercel** (API routes may have execution time limits; use external job handlers)
- **AWS Lambda** (for serverless queues and job execution)
- **Docker + Redis** (if hosting your Next.js app yourself)
